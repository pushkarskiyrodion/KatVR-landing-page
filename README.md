## Technologies Used

### React

The KatVR landing page is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. It provides a declarative syntax, efficient rendering, and a virtual DOM for optimal performance.

### SASS

To enhance the styling capabilities of the project, SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) was utilized. SASS is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS with variables, mixins, nesting, and other powerful features. It enables modular and maintainable styling, making it easier to style complex components and maintain a consistent design system.

### HTML5

The project utilizes HTML5 to structure the content and layout of the landing page. HTML5 provides semantic elements, improved accessibility, and enhanced multimedia support, ensuring a robust foundation for the project.

### CSS3

Along with SASS, CSS3 is used for styling the KatVR landing page. CSS3 brings a wide range of styling options, including advanced selectors, animations, transitions, and responsive design features, allowing for visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.

### JavaScript

In addition to React, JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and implement dynamic functionality on the landing page. JavaScript enables features such as smooth scrolling, interactive menus, form validation, and other user interactions.
